        description: "Our fur baby is missing!! Someone was watching her for me while I was in the hospital, and I recently learned had been seriously neglecting her and another Pitt which was hers. She will not tell anyone where the animals are. I am desperately searching for mine! She is about 5 years old. Black with white spots on her paws and head. Very sweet temperament. Last seen in Prospect Pointe apartments in Jackson. Corner building nearest Brookwood 1 development. She answers to Diamond. We don't know if she has sold her to someone or turned her in somewhere. She may even be still in the apartment without care. Please help us find our cat? She is extremely loved! She is my daughters therapy cat! Please she is missed, loved and needed. My daughter does not yet know this situation. Please help me find her so I can at least tell her she is missing but I know where she is. I am so desperate and heartbroken for myself and for my daughter",
