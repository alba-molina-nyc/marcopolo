# marcopolo


## Marco Polo creates a universal location for people to post items that they have lost or found. 
## So they can communicate with others so they have the best chance of getting the items back to their rightful owners.
## Outside of being the designated lost and found app, Marco Polo is different from possible alternatives out there because everything is happening under one website and it is easy to use.
## Whereas other websites make you go through lengthy processes to communicate with others on the site.
